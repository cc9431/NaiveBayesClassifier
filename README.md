# NaiveBayesClassifier

This is an assingment submission for my Intro to AI course at Bard College.
The submission contains four files:
- Two text files (a training set, and a testing set)
- A python script that can do three different versions of a Naive Bayes classifier (raw, m-estimate, and tf-idf probabilities)
- A PDF evaluating the different versions and explaining my results

To test the script run: python nbClassify.py 20ng-train-stemmed.txt 20ng-test-stemmed.txt {version of probability}
